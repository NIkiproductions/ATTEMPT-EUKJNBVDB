# Interactive Love Website

A whimsical, interactive Valentine experience with a playful question flow and a cozy town carousel.

## Run locally

You can open the site in any browser as a static file:

```bash
open index.html
```

Or serve it with a simple local server (recommended):

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

## Customize content

Edit the text and placeholders directly in `index.html`, and adjust styling in `styles.css`.
